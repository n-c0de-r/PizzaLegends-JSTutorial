 Following the tutorial by @drewconley

This tutorial is about learning about some concepts of JavaScript like Classes & Objects, Imports & Exports. How to modularize & struicture code. I'll deviate ahead of time as far as I can, but otherwiese try to follow the tutorial if I can't optimize it in advance on my own. Very curious how this will turn out.
